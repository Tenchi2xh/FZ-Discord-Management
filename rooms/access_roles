To get started, select which language(s) you want to appear in your channel list! You can select more than one, however **we recommend selecting only the one you're currently learning** to avoid cluttering up the side bar. React to the flag icons to select a language!

Select this if you want to notify others that you would like your language mistakes to be corrected while chatting in the Japanese-only, Korean-only, etc. rooms. You will get a :writing_hand:  icon next to your name, signalling others that you would like corrections.

Note to correctors: do the correction in the target language if it's in a restricted language room, or do it in a separate channel (for example #learning-questions) in English and tag the person you are correcting. Please keep the restricted languages rooms free of English.
Some of our members sometimes livestream Japanese video games and will mention this role when they're about to start, so react to this message if you want to be alerted.
